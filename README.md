# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Features

When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm). Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green). The user can click into a time block and enter a to-do task, click the save button for that time block and the text will be saved in local storage. When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.
